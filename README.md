# Petstore

This is a [monorepo](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/blog/2017/08/02/introducing-workspaces/) that solves the coding task I was given by Varjo.

## Â Local development

To start this project locally:

- prerequsities:
  - docker
  - node >=14.x.x
  - yarn
  - docker

1. checkout this repo
2. hit `yarn i`
3. hit `yarn start:dev`

`yarn start:dev` will start every process:

1. frontend
2. backend
3. a docker container, with MongoDB.

The `docker-compose` command will pull a docker mongodb image, and it will be exposed on the port of `27025`. Change it, in the `docker-compose.yml` if you need to.

### Environment variables

The backend requires some environment variables.

#### Backend .env

        â””â”€â”€ tests
            â””â”€â”€ utils
```

So the project is defined to 2 different `yarn` workspaces:

- client
- server

## Client

The client is bootsrapped with `create-react-app`. The client is using the following project structure:

### Structure

```text
    â”œâ”€â”€ api
    â”œâ”€â”€ assets
    â”œâ”€â”€ components
    â”œâ”€â”€ pages
    â”œâ”€â”€ store
    â”œâ”€â”€ stories
    â”œâ”€â”€ styles
    â”œâ”€â”€ tests
    â”œâ”€â”€ types
    â””â”€â”€ utils
```

The components are devided into `common` and generic. The `common` contains the reusable components, such as `Button`, and `Modal`.

### Implementation

Some thoughts of the implementation of the frontend;

The following tools, and utilities has been introduced:

- [`redux`]
- [`redux-persist`] (to demonstrate how to handle JWT on the frontends side for request, alongside with the authorized user object)
- [`storybook`] with readme's (to demonstrate how to write documentation for generic, HOC, reusable components). In an ideal worlds, Storybook has decorators, to provide mock API's, datasheet, etc, for the stories, and their tests.

Example of a basic decorator in storybook [here](https://github.com/zilahir/petstore/blob/master/packages/client/.storybook/decorator.js).

#### Styling

Currently I am favoruing `SCSS Modules` and `styled-components`. I live styled-components, becasue I can avoid inline-styles, that depends on some UI logic, a variable. If i want to help myself in the future, and keep in mind the evolving the UI, the inline styles are the first to avoid.

Example:

```javascript
const PreviewImage = styled.img`
    backgrond-image: `${props => props.bgImage}`
`
```

### Storybook

[`Storybook`](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook) helps keeping the components, and their documentation up to date. It's not just a fancy showoff of components, it also includes their documentation, plus it can (and should!) utilizied to do testing on the components. It's perfect for Unit tests, and Snapshot tests.

- [`ESLint`] (to avoid writing bad code, and enforce coding style within a _team_ (aks: myself))
- [`JSDOC`] (to enforce documentation on functions, and closuresÂ (React Hooks))
- [`husky`] husky makes the usage of git hooks easy
- [`lint-staged`] combined with `husky`, it lints the git staged files, and fails, if the linting failes. This prevents badly formatted code to the git repo. It can also executes tests, and any scripts.

> NOTE: I did not utilze this for the backend. I did it for demonstrating purposes on the frontend. :)

For example:

```text

âœ” Running tasks...
âœ” Applying modifications...
âœ” Cleaning up...

```

## Â Deployment

Let's take a look how is this application deployed;

### Â Frontend

The [client](https://zilahirpetstore.netlify.app/) and the related [storybook](https://petstore-storybook.netlify.app/) are static website (SPA), deployed using [Netfliy](netlify.com).

### Â Backend

The backend is deployed via [serverless](https://www.serverless.com/), and it's deployed into an [`AWS Lambda`](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function.

#### File Upload

The files are uploaded into an AWS-S3 bucket, using [`aws-sdk`](npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk).

## Â CI / CD

Due to simplicity for this project, both 3 subprojects are deployed in the same time, if a commit is pushed to the `master` branch, using [Github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

## Database

The database is a [MongoDB] instance, hosted on [`MongoDB Atlas`](https://cloud.mongodb.com/).

## Linting

I am in love with the following plugins:

### ESLint

| name                      | purpose                                               |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| eslint-plugin-import      | enforces import orders                                |
| eslint-plugin-jsdoc       | enforces writing jsdoc comments                       |
| eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y    | helps maintaining accessibility rules on JSX elements |
| eslint-plugin-unicorn     | brings the best out of us! ðŸ¤˜                         |
| eslint-plugin-react-hooks | helps keeping the rules of react hooks                |

> NOTE: i have my own ESLint config. You can take a look [here](https://github.com/zilahir/eslint-config)

#### Â StyleLint

Writing CSS can be messy real quick. Some StyleLinting can help with this. What I am preferring:

| name                      | purpose                                               |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| eslint-plugin-import      | enforces import orders                                |
| eslint-plugin-jsdoc       | enforces writing jsdoc comments                       |
| eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y    | helps maintaining accessibility rules on JSX elements |
| eslint-plugin-unicorn     | brings the best out of us! ðŸ¤˜                         |
| eslint-plugin-react-hooks | helps keeping the rules of react hooks                |

I was specifically asked to keep on eye on the maintainability of the UI. I am using a various amount of StyleLint plugins, to do the best I can. It helps.

> NOTE: i have my own Stylelint config. You can take a look [here](https://github.com/zilahir/stylelint-config)

## Backend

The backend is written in `NodeJS` using `express`.

| key        | value example                                                                           | purpose                                    |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |

### Test

To demonstrate testing in nodejs world, I have been using `Jest`.

The testcases can be found at `packages/server/tests`

All the tests are passing:

```text
âžœ  server git:(master) âœ— yarn test
yarn run v1.22.10
$ jest
 PASS  tests/dummy.test.ts (18.623 s)
 PASS  tests/tag.test.ts (43.384 s)
 PASS  tests/category.test.ts (52.91 s)
 PASS  tests/user.test.ts (66.229 s)
 PASS  tests/pet.test.ts (70.902 s)
 PASS  tests/store.test.ts (71.414 s)
```
